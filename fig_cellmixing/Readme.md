I recommend using Conda to manage your python environments.  

Most of the scripts used to generate the figures are Jupyter notebooks.  

All the python packages used should be standard packages in your Anaconda base environment (Conda 4.10.3),   
so you could just use the default "Python 3" notebook kernel or "base" Conda environment to run the scripts, or you can use "Light-Seq" environment.
